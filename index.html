    <h2>About Botany Besties</h2>
    <p>
      Hello!  We are the Botany Besties, a Tompkins County 4-H Club in 
      New York.  We will learn all about plants and have fun through 
      workshops, field trips, experiments and community service projects, 
      all while meeting and making new friends!</p>

    <p>Members of the Botany Besties Club were asked to share some of 
      their goals of what they wanted to learn.  Many of the answers 
      talked about learning more in depth, doing experiments, and 
      understanding how things work, while others talked a lot about 
      community service.  In this club, we tried to incorporate all 
      of these ideas.  In addition to having members answer, one of 
      the future Co-Leaders shared some goals about what they would 
      like the members to take away with them into the future.  They 
      wanted to help kids manage their world better by giving them a 
      safe place to learn, discover, and meet new friends.  They hoped 
      to offer the members a way to think about their world as a livable 
      and kind place.  They also wanted the Club members to have the 
      power to mold and improve the world they live in.  They hoped to 
      strengthen the member's spirits in becoming more confident leaders, 
      feeling good about who they are, and offering the members hope of a 
      bright and beautiful future.</p>
