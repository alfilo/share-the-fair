    <h3>A big Thank You to everyone who made this possible!</h3>
    <p class="news">Thank you to everyone who helped make this website possible: 
      Brenda, who helped with the paperwork and logistics to make
      everything possible this year, my father, who taught me to
      code, all the 4-H leaders who gave us the content for this
      website, and the 4-H members who took videos and pictures
      and told about what they love doing in 4-H.  Thank you for
      helping us celebrate all the wonderful things that are
      happenig in our community and we look forward to doing this
      again next year.  We're looking forward to seeing everyone

    <h2>Goals of the Share the Fair project</h2>
    <p>It would be wonderful for both the youth and the community for us to show
      how the 4-Hers, even through the pandemic, have thrived and persevered,
      continuing to develop their leadership skills, strengthening the bond between
      4-H and their community, committing to personal growth, and doing so many
      wonderful projects and activities this last year.  The New York State 4-H
      Mission statement states: 4-H connects youth to hands-on learning opportunities
      that help them grow into competent, caring, contributing members of society. 
      Their vision is a world in which youth and adults learn, grow and work together
      as catalysts for positive change.  The Share the Fair website enables us to work
      together to make this positive change happen.  By joining together, people all
      over our county can still have a day at the fair.</p>

    <h2>4-H Pledge</h2>
    <p>I pledge my head to greater thinking,<br>
    My heart to greater loyalty,<br>
    My hands to greater service,<br>
    And my health for better living<br>
    For my club, my community, my country, and my world.</p>
