    <h2>Goals of the Share the Fair project</h2>
    <p>It would be wonderful for both the youth and the community for us to show
      how the 4-Hers, even through the pandemic, have thrived and persevered,
      continuing to develop their leadership skills, strengthening the bond between
      4-H and their community, committing to personal growth, and doing so many
      wonderful projects and activities this last year.  The New York State 4-H
      Mission statement states: 4-H connects youth to hands-on learning opportunities
      that help them grow into competent, caring, contributing members of society. 
      Their vision is a world in which youth and adults learn, grow and work together
      as catalysts for positive change.  The Share the Fair website enables us to work
      together to make this positive change happen.  By joining together, people all
      over our county can still have a day at the fair.</p>

    <h2>4-H Pledge</h2>
    <p>I pledge my head to greater thinking,<br>
    My heart to greater loyalty,<br>
    My hands to greater service,<br>
    And my health for better living<br>
    For my club, my community, my country, and my world.</p>
