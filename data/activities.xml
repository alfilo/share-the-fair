        <description>Kritter Kamp is a program for youth between the ages
        of 9 and 13 who have an interest in learning more about farm animals
        (dairy, goats, sheep, dog and rabbits). Experienced 4-H teens mentor
        the campers as they learn about animal behavior and care, different
        breeds, anatomy, the importance of agriculture and farm animals in our
        society, and general safety with animals. They will be provided with
        an animal and the equipment needed for the care and preparation of
        the animal for show. The highlight will be a show experience Saturday
        afternoon. Participants will demonstrate what they have learned as they
        present their animal in the show ring.</description>

        <demonstration>There will be a live rabbit hopping
        demonstration at the Pole Barn.</demonstration>
        <summary>Rabbit hopping was first introduced in the 1970s in
        Europe.  The rules are based on the rules of horse show jumping,
        modified to better suit rabbits.  There are several different types
        of courses to compete in.  The youth at 4-H assembled this video
        to demonstrate a straight course.</summary>

        <name>Stomach</name>
        <category>Animals/Dairy Cattle/Anatomy</category>
        <details>
        Dairy cattle are ruminants, meaning their stomach is divided into four compartments. 
        These compartments are often refered to as "stomachs".  The food travels through
        the stomachs in reverse alphabetical order, the rumen first, then the reticulum,
        followed by the omasum, and finally the abomasum.</details>
        <stomachs>
            <rumen>The rumen is the first stomach.  It is sometimes called the "fermentation vat",
            since it is the largest stomach in a cow's body (taking up 80%).  Microorgamisms in the
            rumen, bacteria, fungi, and protazoa, ferment grasses, breaking down the carbohydrates. 
            It also breaks down some protein.  The protein that gets broken down in the rumen is
            called rumen degradeable protien; the protein that passes through unchanged is called
            rumen undegradeable protein, or by-pass protein.  Volatile fatty acids are also produced
            in this stomach.  Acetic acid is used for energy and milkfat.  Butyric acid is an
            undesireable component of silage.  Propionic acid is the precursor to glucose. The
            rumen is not fully developed in a newborn calf.  It is important to give calves grain
            and hay to facilitate the development of the rumen.  Normally, a calf starts chewing its
            cud at 2-3 weeks of age, when the rumen is more fully developed.</rumen>
            <reticulum>The reticulum is also known as the honeycomb.  It is the stomach compartment nearest
            the heart.  Hardware disease occurs in this stomach.  Hardware disease happens when a cow
            swallows hardware.  To decrease the risk of the hardware piercing the wall of the reticulum
            and piercing the heart, cows are given magnets using a balling gun.  If the cow licks her
            nose after the magnet is given, it's likely that they have swallowed the magnet.</reticulum>
            <omasum>The omasum is the third stomach, sometimes called the manyplies, since its many
            folds look like the pages of a book.  The extra surface area provided by the folds helps
            the omasum to dehydrate food before it is passed on into the abomasum.</omasum>
            <abomasum>The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach.  Since it is the stomach closest
            to a human's stomach, it is also known as the true stomach.  It is the largest stomach
            at birth, taking up 25% of a calf's body.  The esophogeal groove diverts milk past the
            rumen, which is not fully developed yet, and into the abomasum.  The abomasum uses acid
            to break down proteins into amino acids, which will later be absorbed in the small
            intestine.</abomasum>

        <summary>The Botany Besties 4-H Club is committed to helping provide food security as
        our community service project.  Our food donation project was crafted by one of our
        club members, Greta Garrison. Her goal is to provide fresh food access through the
        Friendship Donation Network which provides fresh vegetables to underserved members
        of our community. Last summer each club member was encouraged to plant a row in
        their garden for donation. When planning your gardens this spring, we invite you to
        dedicate a small space, and place in your heart to this program.  For more information
        on how you can help, contact our project manager at stickandstonefarm@gmail.com, or

        addition to the inability to pay for food, many individuals live in a food desert. 
        This means that the closest grocery store may be miles away, too far to walk, and
        public transportation is inconvenient or unaffordable to this population.  Vegetables
        do not keep well, and they need to be shopped for frequently in order to be fresh and
        have high nutritional value.  For the individuals who are at or below the poverty line,
        there are limited food choices.  Many are high in calories, but they are not always
        high in nutrition.  Obtaining high nutrition vegetables can be very expensive and
        inaccessible for this group.  I would like to create a comprehensive growing and education
        plan to address these issues.  Overall, I would like to build bridges between the many
        organizations helping to combat food insecurity in my community to create a stronger
        program with a continuum of education and support from the beginning to the end of the
        program.  Through word of mouth, support for each other, education, and collaboration,
        I hope for this program to become self-supporting, grow, and encourage others to help
        their communities.  This pilot program will serve as a model to extend to other
        communities.</summary>

        <name>Bird Count with Cornell</name>
        <category>Community Service/Citizen Science</category>
        <summary>Plenty of people turned to birdwatching during the past year,
        seeking enjoyment and relaxation. Chickadees, cardinals, finches and
        other birds are doing their part to lift human spirits.  The 24th annual
        Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC), Feb. 12-15, is a great opportunity
        for budding birdwatchers and bird-count veterans to use their skills.
        People from around the world count the birds they see for at least 15
        minutes on one or more days of the count, and then enter their checklists
        online.  This helps to track the bird populations and migration routes.</summary>

        <name>Stream Biomonitoring Sampling</name>
        <category>Community Service/Citizen Science</category>
        <summary>The activity at the October 2020 4-H Finger Lakes Conservation
        Club meeting was working with staff
        from the CSI (Community Science Institute) to do stream biomonitoring
        sampling following protocols similar to the Department of Environmental
        Conservation (DEC).  Members of the club learned about water quality
        and stream benthic macro invertebrates that live under the rocks in
        the stream. Water samples as well as organisms that were collected
        were taken and put into a data base to create a Biological Assessment
        profile to determine the biodiversity and health of the stream.</summary>
        <results>Adrinna Hirtler from the CSI reported on the results of the stream
        biomonitoring:  A few weeks ago some hardy volunteers and I finished sorting
        and identifying the 2020 benthic macroinvertebrate biomonitoring samples. 
        I'm attaching a pdf showing the results for all 21 sites (in 12 different
        creeks) that were sampled. You can find more details about what the results
        mean on the CSI website (http://www.communityscience.org/bmi-results/) but
        to understand them at a quick glance, the number in the column on the right
        (Biological Assessment Profile or BAP) gives you an overall assessment of
        water quality at each site. The Cascadilla Creek downtown site curiously
        improved compared with recent years, though there are still quite a number
        of sites showing slight impacts. These results are now part of what's
        becoming a very nice long-term data set for many creeks in our area. 
        Congratulations to all of the wonderful volunteers who have contributed
        over the years and who continue to contribute today. Thanks especially to
        Paul Allderige who came into the lab almost every week this winter for
        Thursday open lab nights to help work through all of the samples. We
        were limited by the number of people allowed in the lab at once due to
        the pandemic, but none of the volunteers who came to help (we sincerely
        appreciate you ALL) were limited in their energy, keen observations and
        enthusiasm. Thanks again for a fun and productive sample sorting season!

        <name>Kindness Rocks</name>
        <category>Community Service/Helping our Community</category>
        <description>Even during a pandemic, members of the Finger Lakes
        Conservation Club discovered "Kindness Rocks" and shared the idea
        with the Milk Duds/Jolly Ranchers 4-H club!  Below is a selection
        of the rocks members recently painted.  They will now leave these
        in the community for others to find.  One Kindness Rock was left
        by a member of the Finger Lakes Conservation Club at one of the blue
        food pantry.  The individual who found the rock posted a picture on
        Facebook saying how much they needed to hear the kind words that day.
        Help spread the kind words by making kindness rocks for your community
        as well!  Two cloverbuds also made videos describing the kindness rocks (or
        peace rocks) they made with their club, the Milk Duds.</description>

        <name>Favorite Kitchen Tools</name>
        <category>Culinary Arts</category>
        <description>What are your favorite kitchen tools?  Submit your tool,
        a picture, and a short description of why you like it.</description>
        <pastry-cutter>My favorite tool is the pastry cutter because I love making
        pie crust and it helps me cut the butter in faster.  Since it's metal, it
        stays cold and doesn't melt the butter, which makes the pie crust flakier.
        </pastry-cutter>
        <biscuit-cutter>My mom used this biscuit cutter when she was a kid.  It wasn't
        used a whole lot, so we're trying to make up for that now.  The scalloped
        edges turn brown and crispy, and every time I bite into a biscuit we cooked
        with this pastry cutter, I think of my mom and grammy.</biscuit-cutter>
        <whisk>Whisks are super cool!  If you whisk fast enough, you can make
        fluffed egg whites for marangues.  You can use them when making homemade
        gravy to keep lumps from forming (this is mainly what I use the whisk for;
        my gravy is generally lumpy).  They also combine your eggs and sugar into brownies. 
        Yum!  Thank you, whisk!</whisk>

            flavor before stuffing or packaging.</tip>
            <tip>Be precise on salt measurements.</tip>
            <tip>Make sure your scales are tared to zero before
            measuring.</tip>
            <tip>Make sure the scales are measured in g or kg.</tip>
            <tip>Add a quarter cup of water to the meat when

        <have-some-fun-with-your-veggies>We picked veggies from our garden and
        made art with them. You could make a person, a butterfly,or even a Mr.
        Potatohead! Afterwards, try to reuse the veggies.  This could be making
        an omlet, a salad, a pizza, or just eating them plain!  Don't worry,
        you don't need to cook the Mr. Potatohead. He's reusable veggie art! 
        Have some fun with your veggie art, and eat healthy!</have-some-fun-with-your-veggies>

        <summary>We know that there has been a lot of baking happening during the pandemic –
        it’s time to put on your apron, get out your favorite recipe and bake a delicious treat!
        The Holiday Bake off for Kids brings two important concepts together – positive youth
        development and baking! This contest is open to ALL youth 5 – 18 years of age. Youth
        work with an adult mentor to create an entry in one of the following categories: Cookies,
        Cakes, Breads, Decorated Items, Healthy Choices, and Candy.  The goal of the contest is to
        increase knowledge and appreciation of food around holiday celebrations, to build and
        strengthen the tradition of families baking together, to recognize skill and culinary
        arts talent, and to have FUN! So what are you waiting for, spend some quality time with
        your sons and daughters and whip up something delicious in the kitchen, they will
        learn to cherish this time with you. The “Best in Contest” will earn the giant Golden
        Spoon Award.  The Holiday Bake Off is held during National Baking Week in October at
        the Shops at Ithaca Mall.</summary>

        <text-version>Projects are graded against a set of criteria, not
        against other projects.  A blue ribbon means the project is
        excellent, and meets expectations.  Red ribbons mean good,
        projects meet most expectations.  White ribbons are given to projects
        that have met some expectations, but not all.  At the 4-H Fair,
        some projects are also given a marking called "Selected for State",
        meaning that they exceeded expectations and the 4-Her went above and beyond
        in creating the project.  The project will then go to be judged
        at the State Fair.</text-version>
